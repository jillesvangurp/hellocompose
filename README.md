# hellocompose

Sample project to play with jetpack compose web / multiplatform and tailwind css.

- Sets up tailwind such that it works. see `tailwind.config.css`
- Sets up custom dev server so it doesn't open a new tab every time you start the damn thing. Also does not auto reload, so you can choose when to reload. `webpack.config.d/devserver.config.css`
- Uses refreshVersions plugin as well.
- Latest gradle 8.x setup too

Pieced this together from various sources so you won't have to.
